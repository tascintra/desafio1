## 🏆 The challenge
The challenge was to build an algorithm to reverse a string without using language built-in functions.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Reveal the reverse characters of their input.

<br>

## 🎯 Learning goals

Solve this puzzle by manipulating arrays.

<br>

## 🚀 Technologies

This project was built using following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GIT

<br>

## 💻 Project

The main challenge on this project was to build the solution to keep only one drop down menu opened at once. So I had to create the alternance feature with JavaScript. And I also created a function to identify and close the drop down menu when the user clicks outsite of them. I build the responsiveness using media queries and the main content has multiple breakpoints creating the optimal layout for small screens and big screens.

## ✔️ I learned

How to build JavaScript drop down menu interations and mobile menu interations and improved my DOM and positioning skills.

<br>

## 👨‍💻 Continued development

Now for the next project I'll refactor the [loopstudios](https://github.com/tascintra/loopstudios) project that I made some time ago and wasn't able to finish the challenge. The loopstudios project is a landing page that has some interactions with mobile menu and is challenging to make the proposed positioning in the page.
