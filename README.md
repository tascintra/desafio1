## 🏆 The challenge
The challenge was to build an algorithm to reverse a string without using language built-in functions.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Reveal the reverse characters of their input.

## 🚀 Technologies

This project was built using following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GIT
- Figma

## 💻 Project

For this project I made a joke in the design with the Coca-Cola logo that some people believe to make a strange phrase when reversed. I solved this challenge by manipulating the string as an array and using a decrementing for to get the string's end and rewrite its content in a new variable. I also created the project layout design on Figma.

## 👨‍💻 Continued development

The next step for this project is its refactor using React.
